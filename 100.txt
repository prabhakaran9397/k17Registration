Hello Folks

India's biggest technical symposium is back again this year, bigger and better!!!

We have 33+ events for you to participate in and bag cash prices worth 1 million.

We welcome you to the Kurukshetra 2017 Hackathon which is all set to happen in this February 2017!

The topic for the Hackathon is Disaster Management! We invite you to join in the spirit of hackathon by building that idea you've been thinking about and put together a working version to show the world. We want to do this because we feel that innovation is best demonstrated by bringing ideas to life, even if the first version may not be perfect.

Venue and time,

IT Department, College of Engineering, Guindy

17th February, 2017 (6 PM) to 18th February, 2017 (6 PM)
We look forward to meeting you in K! Hackathon. [REGISTER HERE -> http://bit.ly/K17-Hackathon]

Cheers
Kurukshetra'17 Hackathon Team
